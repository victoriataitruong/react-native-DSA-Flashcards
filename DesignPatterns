1. Singleton Pattern – The Ice Cream Truck
Imagine there’s only one ice cream truck in your town. No matter where you go, if you want ice cream, you have to go to that same truck.

This is like a Singleton—only one exists, and everyone shares it!
Example: A game leaderboard that keeps track of scores. There’s only one scoreboard for everyone.

2. Factory Pattern – The Toy Factory
Think of a big toy factory. You don’t build your own toys; instead, you tell the factory, “I want a teddy bear” or “I want a toy car,” and the factory makes it for you.

The Factory Pattern is like this—it makes things for you so you don’t have to worry about how they’re made!
Example: In a game, if you want a "zombie" or a "dragon," you just ask the monster factory, and it creates one for you!

3. Observer Pattern – The School Bell
When the school bell rings, all the students know it’s time to leave. The bell doesn’t tell each student one by one—it just rings, and everyone reacts.

That’s how the Observer Pattern works—one thing (the bell) changes, and many things (students) respond!
Example: When you post a picture on Instagram, all your followers get notified automatically!

4. Decorator Pattern – A Birthday Cake
You start with a plain cake. Then you add chocolate, then sprinkles, then candles. The cake keeps getting better, but the base cake stays the same!

The Decorator Pattern lets you add things without changing the original!
Example: You start with a basic car, then add a turbo engine, fancy lights, and a spoiler—but it’s still the same car underneath!

5. Strategy Pattern – Choosing How to Travel
Imagine you want to go to the park. You can:

Walk
Ride a bike
Take a bus
Each one gets you there, but in different ways. You choose which one works best for you!

The Strategy Pattern is like this—it lets you pick the best way to do something!
Example: In a racing game, you can choose between “Speed Mode” or “Drift Mode”, and the car behaves differently depending on your choice!


FODSS:
Factory - Premade items, like in art app, if you want circle you just ask the circle factory
Observe - Social media, when you post something everyone gets notified
Decorator - You can add without changing the original. You can order a cake at the bakery and then design it however you want
Singleton - Everyone uses the same one, in an app everyone uses same connection string
Strategy - Choosing how you want to travel, by walk by bike, etc
