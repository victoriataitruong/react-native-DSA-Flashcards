A hash table is like a magic dictionary that helps you quickly find things. It stores data in key-value pairs and uses a special function (hash function) to find things fast.

Instead of searching through a long list of names, we can use a hash function to instantly find a student by their locker number!

const lockerSystem = { 101: "Alice", 102: "Bob", 103: "Charlie" }; 
console.log(lockerSystem[101]); // Output: 
Alice console.log(lockerSystem[102]); // Output: Bob

Instead of searching one by one, we just jump to the right box instantly!
