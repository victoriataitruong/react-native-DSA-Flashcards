Here's a super simple graph with just three friends:
•	Alice is friends with Bob and Charlie.
•	Bob is friends with Alice.
•	Charlie is friends with Alice.
Code:
const friends = { Alice: ["Bob", "Charlie"], Bob: ["Alice"], Charlie: ["Alice"] }; 
console.log(friends);
How to Read This?
•	"Alice": ["Bob", "Charlie"] → Alice is connected to Bob and Charlie.
•	"Bob": ["Alice"] → Bob is only connected to Alice.
•	"Charlie": ["Alice"] → Charlie is only connected to Alice.
It's just a big list of who is connected to whom!
