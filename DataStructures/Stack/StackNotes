A stack is like a toy box where you can only put toys in the top, and when you want to take a toy out, you have to take the one from the top too. Think of it like a stack of plates in a cafeteria. If you add a plate to the top, itâ€™s the one you take first when you want one. It's called Last In, First Out (LIFO). The last plate you put on top is the first one you take.
