Let’s think about a set as a magical box that holds things, but there’s a special rule: you can only put something in the box once. So, if you try to put the same thing in the box again, it won’t work!
Code:
// Create a new Set let toyBox = new Set(); // Add toys to the box toyBox.add("Car"); toyBox.add("Doll"); toyBox.add("Truck"); toyBox.add("Car"); // This won't work, because "Car" is already in the box! // Show the toys in the box console.log(toyBox);
